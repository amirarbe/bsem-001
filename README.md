this is  my project in which use artificial intelligent language and create a image modelAn image model object stores information about an image such as class, type, display range, width, height, minimum intensity value and maximum intensity value.

The image model object supports functions that you can use to access this information, get information about the pixels in an image, and perform special text formatting. imagemodel works by querying the target image CData.
